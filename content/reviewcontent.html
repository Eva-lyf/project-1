        <p class="title">1. Atom </p>
        <p>
        Atom as a whole, is electrically neutral and therefore contains equal amount of positive and negative charges </p><br><br>

        <p class="title">2. Thomson’s model </p><br>
        <p>
        In Thomson’s model, an atom is a spherical cloud of positive charges with electrons embedded in it. <br><br>

        <p class="title">3. Rutherford’s Atomic Model</p>
        <p>In Rutherford’s model, most of the mass of the atom and all its positive charge is concentrated in a tiny nucleus (typically one by ten thousand the size of an atom), and the electrons revolve around it. <br><br>

        <p class="title">4. Characteristic Spectrum</p>
        <p>Atoms of most of the elements are stable and emit characteristic spectrum. The spectrum consists of a set of isolated parallel lines termed as line spectrum. It provides useful information about the atomic structure.<br><br>

        <p class="title">5. Rutherford Nuclear Model</p>
        <p>Rutherford nuclear model has two main difficulties in explaining the structure of atom: (a) It predicts that atoms are unstable because the accelerated electrons revolving around the nucleus must spiral into the nucleus. This contradicts the stability of matter. (b) It cannot explain the characteristic line spectra of atoms of different elements.<br><br>

        <p class="title">6. Niel’s Bohr Hydrogenic <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Atoms Model </p><br>
        <p>To explain the line spectra emitted by atoms, as well as the stability of atoms, Niel’s Bohr proposed a model for hydrogenic (single electron) atoms. He introduced three postulates and laid the foundations of quantum mechanics: 
          .indent
          <br><br>(a) In a hydrogen atom, an electron revolves in certain stable orbits (called stationary orbits) without the emission of radiant energy. <br><br>(b) The stationary orbits are those for which the angular momentum is some integral multiple of h / 2p. (Bohr’s quantization condition.) That is L = nh / 2p, where n is an integer called the principal quantum number. <br><br>(c) The third postulate states that an electron might make a transition from one of its specified non-radiating orbits to another of lower energy. When it does so, a photon is emitted having energy equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states. The frequency (n) of the emitted photon is then given by hn = Ei – Ef An atom absorbs radiation of the same frequency the atom emits, in which case the electron is transferred to an orbit with a higher value of n. Ei + hn = Ef.
